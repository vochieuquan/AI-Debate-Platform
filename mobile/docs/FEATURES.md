## Analytics Integration

Track user interactions and app performance with a flexible analytics system:

```dart
// Access analytics
final analytics = ref.watch(analyticsProvider);

// Log screen views
analytics.logScreenView('HomeScreen', parameters: {'referrer': 'deeplink'});

// Log user actions
analytics.logUserAction(
  action: 'button_tap',
  category: 'engagement',
  label: 'sign_up_button',
);
```

For more details, see the [Analytics Guide](https://kevinluongdev.github.io/flutter_riverpod_clean_architecture/analytics.html).

## Push Notifications

Complete notification handling with deep linking and background processing:

```dart
// Access notification service
final service = ref.watch(notificationServiceProvider);

// Request permission
final status = await service.requestPermission();

// Show a local notification
await service.showLocalNotification(
  id: 'msg-123',
  title: 'New message',
  body: 'You received a new message from John',
  action: '/chat/john',
  channel: 'messages',
);
```

## Biometric Authentication

Secure fingerprint and face recognition for protecting sensitive operations:

```dart
// Access biometric authentication
final biometricAuth = ref.watch(biometricAuthControllerProvider);

// Authenticate the user
if (isAvailable) {
  final result = await biometricAuth.authenticate(
    reason: 'Please authenticate to access your account',
    authReason: AuthReason.appAccess,
  );
}
```

For more details, see the [Biometric Auth Guide](https://kevinluongdev.github.io/flutter_riverpod_clean_architecture/biometric_auth.html).

## Feature Flags

Runtime feature toggling for A/B testing and staged rollouts:

```dart
// Check if a feature is enabled
if (service.isFeatureEnabled('premium_features')) {
  // Show premium features
}
```

For more details, see the [Feature Flags Guide](https://kevinluongdev.github.io/flutter_riverpod_clean_architecture/feature_flags.html).

```

For more details, see the [Localization Guide](https://kevinluongdev.github.io/flutter_riverpod_clean_architecture/localization.html).

await cacheManager.setItem('user_1', userEntity);
```

## Dynamic Theming
