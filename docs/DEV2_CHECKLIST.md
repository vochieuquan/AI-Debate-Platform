# DEV 2 — Checklist & Status Report

## Current Delivered Scope - Full Summary

This is the current source-of-truth summary for what has been implemented in this workspace. It includes Dev 2 plus related room, judge, host, player action, and frontend integration updates.

### Backend Delivered

- Matchmaking: ranked queue join/leave/status, auto-match, active rank room creation, and `DebateSession` creation.
- Custom rooms: create/list/detail/update/delete/join/leave, private room password support, and hydrated participant display names/avatars.
- Lobby roles: owner assigns `debater`, `host`, `judge`, or `viewer`; owner can place debaters into team/speaker slots.
- Debater flow: only assigned debaters can choose their own team and speaker slot.
- Lock/start: lock applies to debaters only; start validates filled/locked debater slots and requires assigned human host for human-host rooms.
- Debate engine: current session, next turn, finish phase, CE pass, CE finish, end debate, replay/result payloads, final scores, and rank updates when eligible.
- Permissions: assigned host controls only for `hostId`; judge scoring only for assigned judges, enforced by backend.
- Player actions: debaters can `surrender` to forfeit or `request draw`; draw completes when both teams request it.

### Frontend Delivered

- Ranked matchmaking page with queue status and matched-room navigation.
- Room list, filters, private-room join, and custom room creation.
- Lobby owner assignment panel for debater/host/judge/viewer.
- Debater-only team/speaker selection.
- Debate room with phase/turn/timer, CE controls, host controls, judge scoring, score display, surrender/draw gear menu, and completed-state `Thoát phòng` button.
- Replay/result screen using the replay payload.

### Documentation / Verification

- API endpoints and implementation guide have been updated to match current code behavior.
- `backend npm run build` passes.
- `frontend npm run build` passes.

Older progress tables below are historical checklist material and may not reflect the latest completed implementation as accurately as this section.

## Implementation Update - Dev 2, June 11 2026

Added latest Dev 2 lobby/debate polish:

- Owner can assign participants as debater/host/judge/viewer in custom room lobby.
- Owner is not forced into a debate team by default.
- Only assigned debaters can select team and speaker slot.
- Lock positions now locks debaters only.
- Human-host rooms require an assigned host before start.
- Live debate host controls show only for the assigned host.
- Judge scoring shows only for assigned judges and backend enforces judge-only submit.
- Debaters have a gear menu for surrender and draw request.
- Completed debates show `Thoát phòng` to leave and return to `/matches`.

Verification:

- `backend npm run build` passes.
- `frontend npm run build` passes.

## 🔗 Dependencies

### Depends On (Dev 3)
- ❌ **Socket.IO timer events** — needed for real-time phase transitions
- ❌ **Socket.IO CE state sync** — needed for CE to work in real-time
- ❌ **Chat messages** — for debate transcript capture

### Dev 2 Provides To
- ✓ **Room state** → Dev 3 broadcasts via Socket.IO
- ✓ **Debate phase/turn** → Dev 3 syncs timer
- ✓ **Judge scoring endpoints** → Dev 4 may use for AI BGK

## 🎯 Key Implementation Notes

### Turn Order (UC-31)
```
Pro S1 (4' speech + 1' cross-exam)
   ↓
Opp S1 (4' speech + 1' cross-exam)
   ↓
Pro S2 (4' speech + 1' cross-exam)
   ↓
Opp S2 (4' speech + 1' cross-exam)
   ↓
Pro S3 (4' speech + 1' cross-exam)
   ↓
Opp S3 (4' speech + 1' cross-exam)
   ↓
Judges: submit scores within 10 minutes
```

### CE State Machine (UC-32)
```
CE Phase:
- Team A asks question (3 minutes combined)
- Team B answers
- Team A can ask follow-up (within quota)
- Repeat until:
  * All questions asked
  * OR 3 minutes elapsed
  * OR Team A clicks "Finish"

Penalty: If Team B doesn't answer within 1 minute per question → deduction
```

### Phase Transitions
```
Motion (1' prep) 
  → Pro S1 speech (4') 
  → Opp S1 speech (4') 
  → Cross Exam phase 1 (3')
  → Pro S2 speech (4')
  → Opp S2 speech (4')
  → Cross Exam phase 2 (3')
  → Pro S3 speech (4')
  → Opp S3 speech (4')
  → Cross Exam phase 3 (3')
  → Judge Feedback (5')
  → Closing (1' prep + 2' speech per side)
  → Final Judging (10' for judges)
  → Completed
```

## 📞 Blockers / Questions to Clarify

- [ ] How to handle judge AI selection? (Fallback if no human judge?)
- [ ] What happens if participant disconnects mid-speech? (Auto-forfeit?)
- [ ] Should speech times be strict or allow +5 sec grace period?
- [ ] How to persist speech transcript? (From Socket.IO messages or from user?)
- [ ] Replay format — video, transcript, score only, or all?
